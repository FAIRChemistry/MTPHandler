This tool contains a data model for microtiter plates (MTP), which is accompanied by functions that allow (i) assgning of concentrations of different molecules to different wells of a MTP plate, (ii) blanking of measurement data, (iii) creation and application of standard curves to yield concentration data, and (iv) storing photometric time-course data of reactions as EnzymeML documents.
